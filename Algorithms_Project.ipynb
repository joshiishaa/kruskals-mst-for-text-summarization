              "b'Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\\n\\nThe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\\n\\nAnd Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\'s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\\n'"

He said one laptop per child could be \\\" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\\\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \\\"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\\\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \\\"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it\\\\'s also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\\\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \\\"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we\\\\'re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we\\\\'re not talking about doing it in three or five years, we\\\\'re talking about months.\\\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \\\"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That\\\\'s for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that\\\\'s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\\\"\\\\n'\",\n          \"b'Women MPs reveal sexist taunts\\\\n\\\\nWomen MPs endure \\\"shocking\\\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.\\\\n\\\\nMale MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \\\"melons\\\" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour\\\\'s Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \\\"Whose Secretary are You, minister\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \\\"Blair Babes\\\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \\\"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say \\\\'melons\\\\' as we spoke.\\\" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women\\\\'s legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \\\"Betty\\\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\"When I said, \\\\'Look you know my name isn\\\\'t Betty\\\\', he said, \\\\'ah but you\\\\'re all the same, so I call you all Betty\\\\'.\\\" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: \\\"Well, you\\\\'ve only succeeded because you\\\\'re a woman.\\\" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: \\\"Oh, you\\\\'ve had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\\\" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.\\\\n\\\\nLiberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: \\\"Lots of people say it\\\\'s like an old boys club. \\\"I\\\\'ve always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\\\" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \\\"We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\\\" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \\\"put up with\\\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: \\\"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \\\"What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.\\\" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.\\\\n'\",\n          \"b'Campbell: E-mail row \\\\'silly fuss\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nEx-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists.\\\\n\\\\nMr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2\\\\'s Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour\\\\'s controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a \\\"silly fuss\\\". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour\\\\'s election campaign.\\\\n\\\\nThe e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \\\"demonising\\\" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour\\\\'s advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.\\\\n\\\\nMr Campbell\\\\'s e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA\\\\'s boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: \\\"Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!\\\" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.\\\\n\\\\nHe said: \\\"Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. \\\"Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. \\\"Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I\\\\'m sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. \\\"Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLater the prime minister\\\\'s spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell\\\\'s use of abusive language. The spokesman said: \\\"The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.\\\" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \\\"very good and polite relations\\\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \\\"very talented\\\". But on the former spin doctor\\\\'s use of language, Mr Straw said: \\\"I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances.

will go on sale for less than 100 xc2xa353.nnhe told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood. he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a linux-based operating system, we have to get the display down to below 20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.nnthe second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.nnwhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however, mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. we put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a tv a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook. mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months. he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. in china they spend 17 per child per year on textbooks. that's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.n\",\n          \"women mps reveal sexist tauntsnnwomen mps endure shocking levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.nnmale mps pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered melons as women made commons speeches, researchers from birkbeck college were told. labour's yvette cooper said she found it hard to persuade commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. some 83 mps gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study whose secretary are you, minister.nnthe research team, under professor joni lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at westminster. but what emerged was complaints from mps of all parties of sexist barracking in the chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. barbara follet, one of the so-called blair babes elected in 1997, told researchers i remember some conservatives - whenever a labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke. former liberal democrat mp jackie ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading mp on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. and ex-tory education secretary gillian shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women betty.nnwhen i said, 'look you know my name isn't betty', he said, 'ah but you're all the same, so i call you all betty'. harriet harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the cabinet well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman. another current member of the cabinet says she was told oh, you've had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with? even after the great influx of women mps at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the cabinet, female mps often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.nnliberal democrat sarah teather, the most recent female mp to be elected, told researchers lots of people say it's like an old boys club. i've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers. prof joni lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of margaret moran mp and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. we expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. we expected to find a couple of shocking episodes. but she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. this was mainly because there were more women present in parliament who were not prepared to put up with the sexist attitudes they came across, prof lovenduski said. but she added some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and i am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. what i think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the house of commons. the interviews are to be placed in the british library as a historical record.n\",\n          \"campbell e-mail row 'silly fuss'nnex-no 10 media chief alastair campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at bbc journalists.nnmr campbell sent the missive by mistake to bbc2's newsnight after it sought to question his role in labour's controversial poster campaign. he later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a silly fuss. mr campbell has recently re-joined labour's election campaign.nnthe e-mail was revealed the day after peter mandelson, former labour minister and now a european commissioner, warned the bbc to steer away from demonising mr campbell. mr campbell messaged newsnight after the programme investigated claims that labour's advertising agency tbwa was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. the images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted tory leader michael howard as fagin, prompted accusations of anti-semitism, claims denied by labour.nnmr campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get trevor beattie, tbwa's boss, to issue a statement. in it, he said just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. now fuck off and cover something important you twats! the e-mail was sent by mistake to newsnight journalist andrew mcfadyen. realising his error, mr campbell then e-mailed mr mcfadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter jeremy paxman would have seen the funny side.nnhe said not very good at this e-mail blackberry malarkey. just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at tbwa has gone to you. for the record, first three sentences of email spot on. no row between me and trevor. posters done by them according to our brief. i dreamt up flying pigs. pigs not great but okay in the circs of tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. tbwa made production. campbell swears shock. final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but i'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter mr p. never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. must look forward not back.nnlater the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on mr campbell's use of abusive language. the spokesman said the person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government. foreign secretary jack straw said he had always had very good and polite relations with mr campbell, who he described as very talented. but on the former spin doctor's use of language, mr straw said i do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. maybe i mix with the wrong kind of journalists. liam fox, tory co-chairman, said the return of mr campbell was a sign of new sinister and
